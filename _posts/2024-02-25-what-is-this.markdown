When I start messing around with the computer I discover that I could spend long hours digging into man pages and config options just to understand why the f*** XOrg was crashing when I tried to switch to the runlevel 5. The success in finding the answers was a shock of adrenaline that I got addicted to the point I end up learning a lot as a byproduct of chasing the next hit. 

One thing led to the other and I started working writing code for more than 20 years, it was one of the best things that happened to me in my life. The thing is that as time went by, that thing that I was doing for fun slowly degraded into a full time office job and that sucks because I really liked to spend my time wandering around the computer science world.

At the beginning when I started to feel “too comfortable” I switched technologies so I could keep feeding my curiosity. It was a great thing to do because I learned a lot, I jumped from RPG on AS400 mainframes to JavaScript, then iOS with Objective-C, then Swift, then Python DJango - Flask - Pandas, then C#, etc, etc… But the problem with this approach is that it requires tons of energy and time. It's great if you are a nerd in your twenty-something. Not so great at the forty-something with a family and kids.

So… Now I’m at that moment again, but this time I don’t want to jump to some other tech-stack to get my dose of adrenaline so instead I decided to invest my time in “this”. This is some block of time I’m going to spend from now on consuming a list of “Things To Try” I had been accumulating for years, and I’m going to write here whatever happens during that process. The objective is to get back to doing what I used to like to do with computers and see where that leads me. Hopefully, I could land a big $ low hours job that free me forever of the capitalist food-chain we are all trapped in, or start working in a supermarket and never touch a computer again.

In any case I’ll reach a new place.
